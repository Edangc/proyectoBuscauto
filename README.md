This repository is about an university project to build an program where we are looking to simplify the search for the dreamed car of the user, apliying a personalized search with a variety of parameters. We recently introduced ourselves into java language, so we expect to learn more with this project and gain more experience.

## Functions of the app

Now that we are programming in java, we can implement a GUI to make the user experience more comfortable. Using it like a base, the program is going to use an account system, so we can separate each user that use the app.

Each user in the program is going to have:

* Name
* Password
* E-mail
* A list with the favourite cars

the app is going to show most of them in a profile section, so the user can see all of his data in one place.

About the search feature, is going to be able to search for:

* Country of origin
* Car company
* Model
* Type
* Transmission
* Relative price
* Circulation price

The last two points are going to be based from Chile standards. All the cars are going to have these parameters, and mostly of them were taken from a [governmental chilean website](http://homer.sii.cl/).

We are open for new ideas to implement, looking to get more knowledge and experience.
